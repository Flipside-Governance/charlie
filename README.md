# Charlie: A Modern Delegation Approach

Since the beginning of the onchain governance, delegation has remained underutilized resulting in centralized organizations that are controlled by a select few whales.

Charlie is a modern delegation approach that aims to solve this problem by providing a decentralized and fair governance system by streamling the manner in which tokens are delegated to strong representatives.

## How it works

Charlie is a simple and intuitive delegation system that allows users to delegate tokens across a range of protocols and networks with the click of a button.

Instead of having to delegate tokens for each protocol individually, users can delegate their tokens to a single representative who will serve as the best proxy ecosystem-wide.

## Adding a Governance Token to Charlie

By default Charlie operates by using an optimized set of governance tokens that are deployed on popular EVM chains. To avoid scams and malicious users, Charlie operates with a defined list of tokens that are supported by the system.
