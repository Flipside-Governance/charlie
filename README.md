# Charlie: A Modern Delegation Approach

Since the beginning of the onchain governance, delegation has remained underutilized resulting in centralized organizations that are controlled by a select few whales.

Charlie is a modern delegation approach that aims to solve this problem by providing a decentralized and fair governance system by streamling the manner in which tokens are delegated to strong representatives.

## How it works

Charlie is a simple and intuitive delegation system that allows users to delegate tokens across a range of protocols and networks with the click of a button. 

Instead of having to delegate tokens for each protocol individually, users can delegate their tokens to a single representative who will serve as the best proxy ecosystem-wide.
